medical0 is powered by advanced Microsoft Phi models: 

1. Model Architecture and Options:  
   - HealthGPT-M3: Powered by Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model
   - HealthGPT-L14: Powered by Phi-4 model
   - Both are enhanced with H-LoRA (Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation)
   - Uses CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14-336 as visual encoder
 
2. Model Integration:
   - These models are integrated with specialized medical knowledge
   - Enhanced with a heterogeneous visual perception system
   - Trained on diverse medical imaging datasets
   - Uses specialized fusion mechanisms to combine visual and textual understanding

3. HealthGPT-M3 Characteristics:
   - Optimized for speed and reduced memory usage
   - 7B parameter base model with additional medical domain tuning
   - Good balance of performance and resource efficiency
   - Handles most common medical imaging tasks effectively
   - H-LoRA rank = 64, alpha = 128

4. HealthGPT-L14 Characteristics:
   - Larger model designed for higher performance
   - Enhanced capabilities for subtle abnormality detection
   - Superior diagnostic reasoning abilities
   - More comprehensive knowledge of rare conditions
   - H-LoRA rank = 32, alpha = 64 (more efficient adaptation)

5. Visual Processing:
   - Utilizes a hierarchical visual feature extraction system
   - Processes images at multiple resolutions
   - Capable of focusing on relevant regions of interest
   - Maintains high-resolution perception of important details

6. Technical Parameters:
   - Input image size: 336x336 pixels
   - VQ codebook size: 8192
   - For image generation, uses H-LoRA rank = 256, alpha = 512
   - Supports FP16 precision for faster inference

7. Task Specialization:
   - Medical visual comprehension: Analysis and interpretation of medical images
   - Medical visual generation: Enhancement and reconstruction of medical images
   - Leverages different H-LoRA weights depending on the task

8. Inference Optimization:
   - Can run on CPU when GPU is unavailable (at reduced speed)
   - Device-agnostic execution supported for both models
   - Dynamic adaptation to available computational resources

9. Limitations:
   - HealthGPT is not a certified medical device
   - Analysis should be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals
   - Limited to 2D image analysis (no 3D volume processing)
   - May have reduced performance on certain rare pathologies
   - Does not replace professional medical judgment
